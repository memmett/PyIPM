PyIPM
=====

Python IPM framework.

This repository also contains numerical experiments and plotting
routines for several projects:

1. The 'A guide to efficient integration schemes for integral
   projection models (IPMs)' paper analysing the accuracy and
   efficiency of various integration schemes by Andria Dawson and
   Matthew Emmett.

   To run all of the numerical experiments for this paper:

   $ python exp_eff_run.py

   To generate the plots:

   $ python exp_eff_plot.py


2. The 'ARTR' project by the Clark Lab at Duke University.

   To run the ARTR experiment:

   $ python exp_artr.py
