PyIPM
=====

Python IPM framework.

This repository also contains numerical experiments and plotting
routines for two projects:

1. The "A guide to efficient integration schemes for integral
   projection models (IPMs)" paper analysing the accuracy and
   efficiency of various integration schemes by Andria Dawson and
   Matthew Emmett;

2. The 'ARTR' project by the Clark Lab at Duke University.


To run all of the numerical experiments for the integration paper:

$ python project.py

To generate the plots:

$ python plot.py


To run the 'ARTR' experiment:

$ python artr.py
